I’m thrilled to share my analysis of the Global Superstore dataset, where I’ve visualized critical insights into order delivery, sales performance, and profitability. 
Here’s what I accomplished:
•	Developed an interactive dashboard that tracks key metrics like average, max, and min delivery times for streamlined order fulfillment insights.
•	Created visualizations to uncover trends in sales, profit, and regional performance helping identify growth opportunities and challenges.
•	Conducted in-depth sales and profit analysis across various regions and product categories to pinpoint growth and profitability drivers.
•	Implemented forecasting models to project future sales and profit trends, supporting proactive decision-making.
